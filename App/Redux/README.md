# Redux

In this directory are declared the reducers.<br/>
>Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

Those reducers are combined inside ```App/Redux/CreateStore.js``` then are passed to the store creation.
